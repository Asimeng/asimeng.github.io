        <h2>Hi, welcome to the webpage of Jesse Asimeng.</h2>        
        <p>
          My name is Jesse. I was born in a small town called Osiem in the Eastern Region of Ghana where I spent most of my childhood.
          I am somewhat introverted delighting in engaging my convoluted thoughts while I keep my own company. 
          Sometimes, these thoughts are channelled to weave words into poetry. I enjoy cooking and trying new recipes but that’s not to say that I’m a good cook. 
          I also enjoy getting my hands dirty with gardening and thus, one shouldn’t be surprised to learn that
          I am a nature-phile who’s fascinated by the natural environment — which has been a getaway for me to find myself, 
          inspiration and sometimes even motivation.
          Given my love for nature, I decided to study the natural sciences, specifically Biological Sciences during my undergraduate studies from 2014 to 2018 at 
          the Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology, Ghana. It was within this period that I had an encounter with Prof. Elsie Effah Kaufmann, 
          a popular Ghanaian academic and the host of the Ghana National Science and Maths Quiz, who first introduced me to Bioinformatics.
          This encounter will heavily influence my career trajectory. After my undergraduate studies, I worked for two and a half years as a research assistant at the 
          Kumasi Centre for Collaborative Research in Tropical Medicine (KCCR) — one of the largest biomedical research institutions in Ghana. 
          Having found a passion for Bioinformatics after encountering Prof. Kaufmann and further interacting with a Bioinformatician at the KCCR, I decided to pursue this relatively new discipline for my postgraduate studies. As such in 2021, with funding from the DAAD, I enrolled as an MSc student in Molecular Biology specialising in Bioinformatics at Stellenbosch University, South Africa. I completed my MSc in March 2023. I am currently utilising transcriptomic data mining approaches to elucidate immunological events occurring during tuberculosis treatment for my PhD, again in Bioinformatics and at Stellenbosch University with funding from the DAAD.
